Digest/Elf version 0.01
=======================

Digest::Elf provides an XS based implimentation of the ElfHash algorithm.
What's that get ya? ElfHash generates resonably unique values from a string
in a reasonably short period of time. I culled the actual algorith from a 
Dr. Dobbs Journal article, they culled it from (I think) the source for the
GNU c complier. If you know better, please let me know.

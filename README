Digest::Elf version 1.4
=======================

Digest::Elf provides an XS based implimentation of the ElfHash algorithm.
What's that get ya? ElfHash generates resonably 32 bit integer value 
from a string in a reasonably short period of time. The actual algorith
was culled from a Dr. Dobbs Journal article and they culled it, I think,
from the source for the GNU c complier. If you know better, please let
me know.
